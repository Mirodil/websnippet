[Interactive Drag and Drop Coloring Concept](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/04/22/interactive-drag-drop-coloring-concept/)Â is a little fun experiment where you can color a website mockup by dragging and dropping a color droplet from a palette. The idea is to simply drag a color from a color palette to a website mockup and color designated areas of it like sections or texts. You might have encountered customization tools before, but Codrops wanted to add some fun to this idea and make it enjoyable to use.

You can drag a color from the color palette and drop it on any area that lights up with a blue outline, including text elements. Once the droplet that you are dragging gets dropped on a content area, a fun little Google Material like animation happens and the whole area gets filled with a colored circle. For that effect we use an SVG element that we create on the fly and then scale it up and fade it in with a CSS transition.
