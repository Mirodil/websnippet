title: "JavaScript Concise methods - ES6"
description: "It’s official, the long wait is finally over, as ECMAScript 6 has been approved as a new standard. The anticipation for this approval has been running wild in the community for months, and years for others. While the evolutionary progress of the language was slow at first, the last few years have seen an incredible growth rate.

A lot of developers and developer publications out there have started to write more concisely about the ES6 standard, and what kind of changes one can expect. The new standard is known under the names of ECMAScript 2015, ES6, and JavaScript Harmony."

ES6 adds a new feature called “concise methods” to object literals and classes we can condense render: `function () {}` to `render()`

    var o = {
       foo() { .. }
    };

And that’s shorthand for the more familiar:

    var o = {
       foo: function() { .. }
    };
