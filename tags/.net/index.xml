      <description>Describe the difference between Interface-oriented, Object-oriented and Aspect-oriented programming. Interface-oriented programming – an interface is created to define the contract and rules, without caring about the implementation. All parties follow the contract and rules and communicate through the contract. One example is Web Service.
Object-oriented programming – classes implements the concept of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. Abstraction means loose coupling between components by providing interfaces. Encapsulation means hiding details of class implementation.</description>
