title: "Lazyr.js – A Small Library for Lazy Loading Images"
description: "Lazyr.js is a small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading images. Lazy loading boosts page speed by deferring the loading of images until they’re in (or near) the viewport. This library makes it completely painless – maximizing speed by keeping options to a minimum.
The scroll event has been debounced to minimize the weight on the browser, and images are revealed within rAF to ensure optimal rendering. For each image, put a placeholder in the src attribute, the regular image in the data-layzr attribute, and the retina image in the data-layzr-retina attribute."

Lazyr.js is a small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading images. Lazy loading boosts page speed by deferring the loading of images until they’re in (or near) the viewport. This library makes it completely painless – maximizing speed by keeping options to a minimum.

The scroll event has been debounced to minimize the weight on the browser, and images are revealed within rAF to ensure optimal rendering. For each image, put a placeholder in the src attribute, the regular image in the data-layzr attribute, and the retina image in the data-layzr-retina attribute.
