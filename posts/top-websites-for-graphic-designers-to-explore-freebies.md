Graphic and web designers are in constant search of new resources to bring freshness to their designing projects. After all, their job is about crafting wonderful pieces of appealing visual art by incorporating the use of the latest tools and resources. Boring repetition is a strict no-no. It is a creative field.

No two websites, newsletters or brochures are identical to each other. It requires a great deal of effort to produce a graphic art which is original as well as appealing. But, what is the major driving force behind a graphic designer’s creativity? It is his imagination.
