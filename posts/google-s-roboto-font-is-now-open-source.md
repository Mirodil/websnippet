Google introduced the [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto) font nearly four years ago as part of Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Since then, it’s grown to be the default for Android and Chrome OS, and it’s a big part of Google’s overall Material Design language that we’re seeing spread across many of its web services as well. Google has announced that their signature font “Roboto” is now officially free to use by any e-reader company.

The font family supports all Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek characters in Unicode 7.0, as well as the currency symbol for the Georgian lari, to be published in Unicode 8.0\. The fonts are currently available in eighteen different styles.
