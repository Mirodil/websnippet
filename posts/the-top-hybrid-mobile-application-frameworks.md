An HTML application is very attractive if you need to support many types of devices and platforms and you either don't have the internal resources to develop and maintain native applications or you don't have the budget to pay someone to do it for you. It's also a tempting option to just reuse a responsive web application that may already exist and save yourself the headache of a new project.

For many companies, the application being device agnostic will trump the user experience and app quality every time. If this is an internal application it's easy to get away with it too because the users are your employees and, well, they have no choice. Still, if you talk to the owners of the project, the people who will ultimately be using the application, they want native and they know why they want native more today than they did 2 years ago. Their desire for an improved UI/UX, better speed, and more advanced functionality will suffer at the hands of an IT mandated HTML5 or hybrid application. 

There are many tools and framework available to help you create Mobile applications. Here are we listed some of them.

## [IONIC](http://ionicframework.com/)

![IONIC](http://i963.photobucket.com/albums/ae120/Mirodil/WebSnippet/unnamed_1.png)

[IONIC](http://ionicframework.com/) is one of the most promising HTML 5 mobile application frameworks. Built using SASS, it provides many UI components to help develop rich and interactive apps. It uses the JavaScript MVVM framework,AngularJS to power apps. Two-way data binding, interaction with backend services and APIs makes AngularJS a mobile developer’s common choice. With the coming release of AngularJS 2.0, focused on mobile, it’s sure to gain even more popularity.

## [Famo.us](http://famous.org/)

[Famo.us](http://famous.org/) is a free, open source JavaScript framework that helps you create smooth, complex mobile applications. Like Ionic, Famo.us is made for hybrid mobile development, though, up to the point, it can be used for desktop web applications development. Famo.us's mobile framework is a newborn baby. Famo.us development looks more like an animation or a game system than like conventional mobile app design.

Basically, Famo.us uses its own JavaScript engine that works with the GPU acceleration provided by CSS3 3D transformation functions to make animations as smooth as can be at 60 fps. It uses a different approach from other frameworks in order to render DOM elements, by not using the DOM at all - Famo.us creates its own DOM rendering tree. Performance-wise, they have done a great job.

## [Mobile Angular UI](http://mobileangularui.com/)
