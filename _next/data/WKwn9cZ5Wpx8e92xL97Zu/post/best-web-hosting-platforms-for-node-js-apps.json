Though Node.js can be used in almost every scenario but there are some cases where Node.js does not work so well. It is not feasible where a single threaded calculation must hold successive approximation, so it would be more convenient to leave the request to a library dedicated to this task.\n\nAre you also looking to host your Node.js applications; then you must have something to add to this list.
