The flexibility that JavaScript gives us with web applications and on the server was a dream to achieve just some year back. Node.js which has became a next big thing for developers is an open source and runtime environment focused on developing networking and server side applications. The Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be executed within Node.js environment on platforms like FreeBSD, Windows, Linux, NonStop, OS X etc. Node.js also builds network programs like web servers similar to Python and PHP but the major thing that distinguishes Node.js is that it is a non-blocking language which means that commands runs parallel to each other and they use callbacks as an indication for signal completion.","date":"2015-08-13T14:12:01.578Z","lastmod":"2015-08-13T14:12:01.578Z","slug":"best-web-hosting-platforms-for-node-js-apps","categories":["Web-Development","Resources","Development"],"tags":["Node.JS"],"thumbnail":"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tcBliK6fN4/WhDK9gRtsTI/AAAAAAAAD24/QWBZCzXmABQAxZkRCUNOI4gjcjO7EHLSgCLcBGAs/s400/nodejs.png","image":"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9tcBliK6fN4/WhDK9gRtsTI/AAAAAAAAD24/QWBZCzXmABQAxZkRCUNOI4gjcjO7EHLSgCLcBGAs/s1600/nodejs.png","source":"","permalink":"/post/best-web-hosting-platforms-for-node-js-apps"},{"title":"PHP Libraries for Developers","description":"These days, PHP is making a lot of buzz for being an effective server-side programming language for web development.  PHP libraries perform a useful function of extending the core functionality of the language. A library is a vast collection of useful resources, such as pre-written codes, classes, values, message templates, configuration data and more. Currently, there are a bunch of PHP libraries that can execute web development with greater speed and efficiency. Here are listing down the names of 15 such PHP libraries that can aid developers in their projects.
