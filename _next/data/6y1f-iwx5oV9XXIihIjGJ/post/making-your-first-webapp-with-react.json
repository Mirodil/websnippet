This results in a vast wealth of reusable [components](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/react-component) for it that will save you time when coding. The library itself encourages writing loosely coupled code that is modular and composable.\n\nIn this tutorial, I will show you how to create a small application and how to split it into discrete components that talk to each other. As a base, we will take the [npm-driven website example](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/03/npm-driven-website/) from last month, but we’ll do it the React way. It is interesting to compare the results – the React version has a few more lines of code than the jQuery version, but we can both agree that it is much better organized.\n\n### What you need to know about React\n\n*   It is a popular client-side library/framework for building user interfaces, which is developed and used by Facebook.\n*   With it, you organize your application around discrete components, with each handling its own rendering and state. Components can be nested within each other.\n*   React is fast because it minimizes the number of writes to the DOM (the slowest part of any client-side application).\n*   The recommended way to write React code is by using JSX – an extension to JavaScript which presents components as HTML elements. JSX needs to be compiled to JS in order to work in browsers.\n*   It hasn’t hit version 1.0 as of this writing, so there might be changes in the future.\n*   We have a nice article with [examples for learning react](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/07/5-practical-examples-for-learning-facebooks-react-framework/) which you can check out. Also there is the official getting started guide [here](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html).","permalink":"/post/making-your-first-webapp-with-react","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":38},{"name":"Interview","count":4},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":15},{"name":"System Design","count":3},{"name":"System-Design","count":2},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":37}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":7},{"name":"HTML","count":4},{"name":"Interview","count":9},{"name":"JavaScript","count":27},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
