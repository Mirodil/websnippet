If one of the watcher is relied upon by another watcher, Angular would have to re-run the digest cycle again, to make sure that all of the changes has propagated. It will continue to do so, until all of the watchers have been updated and app has stabilized.\n\nEven though running JavaScript in modern browsers is really fast, in Angular it is fairly easy to add so many watchers that you app will slow down to a crawl.\n\nKeep in mind the following when implementing or refactoring an Angular app:\n\n1.  Watches are set on:\n    *   `$scope.$watch`\n    *   `{{ }}` type bindings\n    *   Most directives (i.e. `ng-show`)\n    *   Scope variables `scope: { bar: '='}`\n    *   Filters `{{ value | myFilter }}`\n    *   `ng-repeat`\n2.  Watchers (digest cycle) run on\n    *   User action (`ng-click` etc). Most built in directives will call `$scope.apply` upon completion which triggers the digest cycle.\n    *   `ng-change`\n    *   `ng-model`\n    *   `$http` events (so all ajax calls)\n    *   `$q` promises resolved\n    *   `$timeout`\n    *   `$interval`\n    *   Manual call to `$scope.apply` and `$scope.digest`\n\n##  Avoid ng-repeat. If you have to use ng-repeat use infinite scrolling or pagination\n\nThis was the biggest win for our app. I am not going to go into too much details, but I found the article “[AngularJS: My solution to the ng-repeat performance problem](http://www.williambrownstreet.net/blog/2013/07/angularjs-my-solution-to-the-ng-repeat-performance-problem/)” to be extremely helpful.\n\nFor example a unique step id, is a good value to track by when doing an ng-repeat.\n\n    <li ng-repeat=\"doc in docs track by doc.Id></li>\n\n## Use Bind once when possible\n\nAngular 1.3 added `::` notation to allow one time binding. In summary, Angular will wait for a value to stabilize after it’s first series of digest cycles, and will use that value to render the DOM element. After that, Angular will remove the watcher forgetting about that binding, more about [here](https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.15/docs/guide/expression#one-time-binding).\n\n## Use $watchCollection instead of $watch (with a 3rd parameter)\n\n`$watch` with only 2 parameters, is fast. However, Angular supports a 3rd parameter to this function, that can look like this: `$watch('value', function(){}, true)`. The third parameter, tells Angular to perform deep checking, meaning to check every property of the object, which could be very expensive.\n\nTo address this performance issue, angular added `$watchCollection('value', function(){})`. $watchColleciton acts almost like $watch with a 3rd parameter, except it only checks the first layer of object’s properties, thus greatly improving the performance.\n\n## Avoid repeated filters and cache data whenever possible\n\nOne time binding does not seem to play well with filters. There seems to be work arounds to make it work, but I think it’s cleaner and more intuitive to simply assign the needed value to a variable (or set it as a property on an object, if you are dealing with a lot of variables).\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n    {{'DESCRIPTION' | translate }}\n\nYou can do:  \n– In JavaScript `$scope.description: $translate.instant('DESCRIPTION')`  \n– In HTML `{{::description}}`\n\nOr instead of: `{{step.time_modified | timeFormatFilter}}`\n\nIn JavaScript\n\n    var timeFormatFilter = $filter('timeFormatFilter');\n    step.time_modified = timeFormatFilter(step.time_modified);\n\nIn HTML\n\n    {{::Path.time_modified}}\n\n## Debounce ng-model\n\nIf you know there is going to be a lot of changes coming from an ng-model, you can de-bounce the input.\n\nFor example if you have a search input like Google, you can de-bounce it by setting the following ng-model option: `ng-model-options=\"{ debounce: 250 }`.\n\nThis will ensure that the digest cycle due to the changes in this input model will get triggered no more then once per 250ms, more about [model options](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngModelOptions).\n\n## Use ng-if instead of ng-show (but confirm that ng-if is actually better for your use case)\n\n`ng-show` will render an element, and use `display:none` to hide it,  \n`ng-if` will actually removes the element from DOM, and will re-create it, if it’s needed.\n\nYou may need ng-show for an elements that toggles on an off often, but for 95% of the time, ng-if is a better way to go.\n\n## Use Batarang to benchmark your watchers\n\n[Batarang](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang-stable/niopocochgahfkiccpjmmpchncjoapek) is a great tool from the Angular team, and it was very helpful in my debugging efforts. It has a lot of useful features, but the one that was the most relevant to this use-case is the performance tab.\n\n![](http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/m637/Maer007/WebSnippet/1433229511834_zpskh3suh7k.png)","permalink":"/post/top-tips-to-improve-angularjs-performance","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":38},{"name":"interview","count":2},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":15},{"name":"System Design","count":2},{"name":"System-Design","count":2},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":37}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":7},{"name":"HTML","count":4},{"name":"interview","count":5},{"name":"interviews","count":1},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"JavaScript","count":27},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
