{"pageProps":{"title":"Lazyr.js – A Small Library for Lazy Loading Images","description":"Lazyr.js is a small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading images. Lazy loading boosts page speed by deferring the loading of images until they’re in (or near) the viewport. This library makes it completely painless – maximizing speed by keeping options to a minimum. The scroll event has been debounced to minimize the weight on the browser, and images are revealed within rAF to ensure optimal rendering. For each image, put a placeholder in the src attribute, the regular image in the data-layzr attribute, and the retina image in the data-layzr-retina attribute.","date":"2015-05-21T13:14:56.730Z","lastmod":"2015-05-21T13:18:13.597Z","slug":"lazyrjs-a-small-library-for-lazy-loading-images","categories":["Web-Development","Development"],"tags":["JavaScript"],"thumbnail":"http://rs963.pbsrc.com/albums/ae120/Mirodil/WebSnippet/unnamed_8.jpg~c200","image":"http://i963.photobucket.com/albums/ae120/Mirodil/WebSnippet/unnamed_8.jpg","source":"http://callmecavs.github.io/layzr.js/","content":"\n\nLazyr.js is a small, fast, modern, and dependency-free library for lazy loading images.
