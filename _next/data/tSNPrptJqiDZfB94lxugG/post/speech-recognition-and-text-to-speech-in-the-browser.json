The speech recognizer will listen to what you say and convert your words to a string.\n\n[Browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-recognition) is currently limited to just Chrome for now. Firefox support can be enabled by setting the `media.webspeech.recognition.enable` flag in `about:config`.\n\n    // This API is currently prefixed in Chrome\n    var SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;\n\n    // Create a new recognizer\n    var recognizer = new SpeechRecognition();\n\n    // Start producing results before the person has finished speaking\n    recognizer.interimResults = true;\n\n    // Set the language of the recognizer\n    recognizer.lang = 'en-US';\n\n    // Define a callback to process results\n    recognizer.onresult = function (event) {\n      var result = event.results[event.resultIndex];\n      console.log('Interim result', result[0].transcript);\n    };\n\n    // Start listening...\n    recognizer.start();\n\n[Demo](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/demos/speech.html)\n\nFor more information, visit the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) and [Web Speech API Specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html)\n\n## Speech Synthesis or Text to Speech\n\nAnother API that might surprise you is the browser's speechSynthesis API. It allows you to make your browser talk. \n\n[Browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=speech-synthesis) is a little better for this API, as it works on both Chrome and Safari (including mobile browsers).\n\n    speechSynthesis.speak(\n      new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World')\n    );\n\nYou can also specify which voice to use:\n\n    var voices = speechSynthesis.getVoices();\n    var utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World');\n    utterance.voice = voices[1];\n    speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);\n\nFor more information, visit the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) and [Web Speech API Specification](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html)","permalink":"/post/speech-recognition-and-text-to-speech-in-the-browser","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":37},{"name":"Interview","count":1},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":14},{"name":"System Design","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":36}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":6},{"name":"HTML","count":3},{"name":"Interview","count":2},{"name":"JavaScript","count":26},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
