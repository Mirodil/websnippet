CSS transitions let you decide which properties to animate, when the animation will start, how long the transition will last, and how the transition will run.\n\n## Basic Animation\n\nThe `transition` property is a shorthand property used to represent up to four transition-related longhand properties:\n\n    .selector {\n        transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];\n    }\n\nThese transition properties allow elements to change values over a specified duration, animating the property changes, rather than having them occur immediately. Here is a simple example that transitions the background color of a `div` element on `:hover`:\n\n    div {\n      transition: background-color 0.5s ease;\n      background-color: red;\n    }\n    div:hover {\n      background-color: green;\n    }\n\nThat div will take half a second when the mouse is over it to turn from red to green. Here is a live demonstration of such a transition:\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\" scrolling=\"yes\" src=\"http://embed.plnkr.co/P8aAhw/\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\nYou can specify a particular property as we have above, or use a value of \"`all`\" to refer to transition properties.\n\n    div {\n      transition: all 0.5s ease;\n      background: red;\n      padding: 10px;\n    }\n    div:hover {\n      background: green;\n      padding: 20px;\n    }\n\nIn this above example, both background and padding will transition, due to the value “all” specified for the `transition-property` portion of the shorthand.\n\nYou may comma separate value sets to do different transitions on different properties:\n\n    div {\n      transition: background 0.2s ease,\n                  padding 0.8s linear;\n    }\n\nFor the most part, the order of the values does not matter -- unless a delay is specified. If you specify a delay, you must first specify a duration. The first value that the browser recognizes as a valid time value will always represent the duration. Any subsequent valid time value will be parsed as the delay.\n\nSome properties cannot be transitioned because they are not animatable properties. See the spec for a full list of [which properties are animatable](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties).\n\nMore examples you can find [here](http://www.css3.info/preview/css3-transitions/)","permalink":"/post/css-transition-in-examples","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":37},{"name":"Interview","count":1},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":14},{"name":"System Design","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":36}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":6},{"name":"HTML","count":3},{"name":"Interview","count":2},{"name":"JavaScript","count":26},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
