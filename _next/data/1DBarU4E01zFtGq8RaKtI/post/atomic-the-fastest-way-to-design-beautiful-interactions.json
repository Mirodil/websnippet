Draw Hotspots over elements in your design and link pages together into a prototype. You can choose to animate these transitions between pages. When the same object exists on both pages, Atomic will animate any changes automatically. These connections between objects are created when you copy-and-paste them from one page to another, or when you duplicate a page. Anything that only exists on one page will be faded in or out. Happy prototyping.","permalink":"/post/atomic-the-fastest-way-to-design-beautiful-interactions","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":38},{"name":"interview","count":2},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":15},{"name":"System Design","count":2},{"name":"System-Design","count":2},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":37}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":7},{"name":"HTML","count":4},{"name":"interview","count":5},{"name":"interviews","count":1},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"JavaScript","count":27},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
