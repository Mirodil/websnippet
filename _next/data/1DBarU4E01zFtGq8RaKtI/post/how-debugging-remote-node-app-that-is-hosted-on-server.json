We will use Putty for SSH Tunneling. So lets get start. \n\nIn order to use port forwarding to connect from your local machine to a port on a remote server, you need to:\n\n*   Choose a port number on your local machine (e.g. 5858 in our case) where PuTTY should listen for incoming connections. \n*   Now, before you start your SSH connection, go to the PuTTY Tunnels panel. Make sure the «Local» radio button is set. Enter the local port (e.g. 5858) number into the «Source port» box. Enter the destination host name and port number into the «Destination» box, separated by a colon (e.g. 127.0.0.1:5858 in our case).\n*   Now click the [Add] button. The details of your port forwarding should appear in the list box.\n\nLaunch Putty. Different categories will be listed on the left side, click on Connection > SSH > Tunnels.  \nUnder Add new forwarded port:, enter the following information:  \nSource port: [port on local machine]  \nDestination: [hostname of ccis machine]:[port on ccis machine]  \nClick Add.   \nIt would look like this if I wanted to forward port 5858 on the webserver to 5858 on my local machine:\n\n![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TaSOvV448KA/WhDJyVYJfoI/AAAAAAAAD2s/qLU76_r1DyEHfhlM4kCSlQNeLmWj6CdnQCLcBGAs/s1600/1436549884873_zps3qaqlohi.png)\n\nClicking Add will add it to the list of forwarded ports:  \n![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2VYJpXOZ3pU/WhDJyRp7bQI/AAAAAAAAD2o/1ePm3R9R4Low8m39QQSJ-lRPLCqxjDw-gCLcBGAs/s1600/1436549938426_zps0pewmatg.png)\n\nAfter setting up the port tunnel, select Session from the category list on the left side.  \nEnter `login.ccs.neu.edu` in the Host Name (or IP Address) field and click the Open button at the bottom right.  \n![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9TKqLoULop0/WhDJyCCzEkI/AAAAAAAAD2k/rWyLs93vb8ILyJDewi0h8f_foPBR3oaBQCLcBGAs/s1600/1436549964122_zpsovegyxzj.png)\n\nSelect Yes if prompted with this window.   \nAnd you will be inside your server, then you have to run your node app with debug flag in PuTTY terminal:\n\n    node --debug app.js\n\nThen you have to install `node-inspector` to your local machine:\n\n    install node-inspector -g\n\n And start `node-inspector` in your local machine:\n\n    node-inspector\n\nNow you can open the following url in you Chrome browser and debug remote nodejs application:\n\n    http://127.0.0.1/debug?port=5858\n\nIt may take sometime to load remote files into your browser.","permalink":"/post/how-debugging-remote-node-app-that-is-hosted-on-server","site":{"categories":[{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"Design","count":10},{"name":"Development","count":38},{"name":"interview","count":2},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"Mobile-Development","count":1},{"name":"Resources","count":15},{"name":"System Design","count":2},{"name":"System-Design","count":2},{"name":"Tools","count":1},{"name":"Web Management","count":5},{"name":"Web-Development","count":37}],"tags":[{"name":".NET","count":2},{"name":"Algorithm","count":1},{"name":"AngularJS","count":4},{"name":"CSS","count":7},{"name":"HTML","count":4},{"name":"interview","count":5},{"name":"interviews","count":1},{"name":"intreview","count":2},{"name":"JavaScript","count":27},{"name":"Mobile","count":1},{"name":"Node.JS","count":8},{"name":"React","count":1},{"name":"Tools","count":1}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
